Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) or follow the steps in [Git Immersion Tutorial](https://gitimmersion.com/).

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the Quiz Manager, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Prefix the commit messages with the component in Quiz Manager
  * `collection`: For improving the collector / collection component
  * `generator`: For improving the generator component
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Python Style Guide
We follow the [PEP8 style guide for Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please use `pycodestyle` and `pylint` on your Python code. Use your best judgement to interpret their reports.
#### Template for functions 
Please consider documenting your code and the following template for functions and documentation of the functions:

    def fooFunction(a, b, c):
      """
      Gives the name of the best bar in town

      :param a: this is the first parameter
      :param b: this is the second parameter
      :param c: this is the third parameter
      :return: a string representing the name
      """

      return 'FooBar'
